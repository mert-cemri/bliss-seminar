<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Normal Approximations for Stochastic Iterative Estimators (and Martingales)</b><br />
<br />
Asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator (mle) is one of the foundational results of mathematical statistics characterizing the fluctuations of mle. But it suffers from two drawbacks: (i) it is asymptotic and (ii) it is established for the maximum likelihood estimator (i.e., argmin of negative log-likelihood function) which often can't be computed efficiently. Indeed, in practice the efficiently computable estimator is typically a stochastic iterative estimator/algorithm, which is run for a finite number of steps. The focus of this talk will be on establishing non-asymptotic normal approximation rates for such stochastic iterative estimators.</p>
<p>The first result of this talk is on establishing non-asymptotic normal approximation rates for stochastic gradient descent (SGD), arguably the most widely used stochastic iterative estimator, for locally strongly-convex (but globally potentially nonconvex) M-estimation problems. This result could be clubbed with existing bootstrap techniques to obtain non-asymptotically valid confidence sets for parameter estimation via the SGD estimator. The second result of this talk is on establishing non-asymptotic normal approximation rates for Euler discretization of ItÃ´ diffusions (a special case of this estimator is the stochastic gradient Langevin Monte Carlo, widely used by the Bayesian community), which is a stochastic iterative estimator used for posterior expectation computation or numerical integration. This result could potentially be clubbed with (yet to be well-developed) bootstrap techniques to obtain non-asymptotically valid Frequentist-style confidence intervals for prediction within the Bayesian framework or non-asymptotically valid confidence intervals for numerical integration in general. </p>
