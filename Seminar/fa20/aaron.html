<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>What Hockey Teams and Foraging Animals Can Teach Us About Feedback Communication</b><br /><br /></p>
<p>Suppose we wish to communicate over a memoryless channel with known statistics. How can the use of a feedback link from the receiver to the transmitter help? We introduce a novel mechanism for using feedback, called timid<i>bold coding, and we show that for some channels timid</i>bold coding yields a strict asymptotic improvement over the best non-feedback schemes. We also show that for a broad class of channels, feedback is useful if and only if timid/bold coding is applicable. The talk contains a puzzle (recently featured on the FiveThirtyEight website), a life lesson, a (potential) practical application, and some stochastic calculus.
This is joint work with Nirmal Shende and Yucel Altug.</p>
