<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Make-or-break issues in fair classification</b><br />
<br /></p>
<p>Training a fair classifier is essential for designing a trustworthy machine learning system.  This talk will begin with an overview of the existing model fairness techniques and our new solutions that overcome their limitations.  Then, I will discuss why the current approaches are highly vulnerable to data poisoning attacks.  I will introduce how one can train fair classifiers in the presence of data poisoning.</p>
