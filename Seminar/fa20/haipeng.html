<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>From bandits to MDPs: optimally and adaptively learning episodic MDPs with adversarial losses</b><br />
<br />
In this talk, I will discuss three recent works on learning episodic tabular MDPs with adversarial losses, with the emphasis on extending techniques from recent advances in the bandit literature to MDPs. In particular, I will discuss how to 1) achieve sqrt{T} regret when learning an episodic MDP with adversarial losses; 2) improve the regret to sqrt{L<b>} where L</b> is the loss of the best policy; and 3) simultaneously adapt to stochastic losses with log(T) regret (or more generally sqrt{C} regret when the losses are corrupted by a total amount of C).</p>
