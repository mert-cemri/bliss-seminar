<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Rates of convergence of Gaussian smoothed empirical measures in Wasserstein and KL distances</b><br />
<br /></p>
<p>Consider an empirical measure P<u>n induced by n iid samples from a d-dimensional K-subgaussian distribution P. Classical work going back to Dudley shows that the speed of convergence of P</u>n to P in squared 2-Wasserstein distance is of order \(n^{-2/d}\). We study the
rate of convergence of P_n<b>N(0,sigma) &ndash; the Gaussian smoothed version of the empirical measure &ndash; to P</b>N(0,sigma). We show that the rate is n^{-1} for \(\sigma &gt; K\) (and any d) and polynomially slower for \(\sigma &lt; K\) (at least for d=1). Surprisingly, the convergence rate in KL remains the same in the former regime, while it provably slows down for \(\sigma &lt; K\), albeit by at most
polylogarithmic (in n) factor. Mismatch in convergence rates between W2 and KL resolves an open problem from
Wang-Wang (Ann. Inst. Poincare, 2016) on existence of log-Sobolev inequalities for subgaussian
mixtures of Gaussians.</p>
