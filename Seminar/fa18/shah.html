<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Battling Demons in Peer Review</b> <br />
Peer review is the backbone of scholarly research. It is however faced with a number of challenges (or &ldquo;demons&rdquo;) such as subjectivity, bias or miscalibration, noise, and strategic behavior. The growing number of submissions in many areas of research such as machine learning has significantly increased the scale of these demons. This talk will present some principled and practical approaches to battle these demons in peer review:
(1) Subjectivity: How to ensure that all papers are judged by the same yardstick?
(2) Bias or miscalibration: How to use ratings in presence of arbitrary or adversarial miscalibration?
(3) Noise: How to assign reviewers to papers to simultaneously ensure fair and accurate evaluations in the presence of review noise?
(4) Strategic behavior: How to insulate peer review from strategic behavior of author-reviewers?</p>
<p>The work uses tools from statistics and learning theory, social choice theory, information theory, game theory and decision theory. (No prior knowledge on these topics will be assumed.)</p>
