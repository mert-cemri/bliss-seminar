<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Online Competitive Algorithms for Resource Allocation</b> <br />
In online optimization with budgets, the data in the optimization problem is revealed over time. At each step a decision variable needs to be set without knowing the future inputs, while there is a budget constraint that couples the decisions across time. In this talk, we consider an online setup that includes problems such as online (budgeted) resource allocation with a fixed inventory, and the ‘Adwords’ problem popular in online advertising. We examine two types of primal-dual algorithms, with a focus on the competitive ratio, i.e., the ratio of the objective achieved by the algorithm to that of the optimal offline sequence of decisions. We give a bound on this ratio and show how certain smoothing of the objective function can improve the bound, and how to seek the optimal smoothing by solving a convex design problem. This approach allows us to design effective smoothing customized for a given cost function and problem structure. The framework also extends to problems with positive semidefinite matrix variables, such as online D-optimal and A-optimal experiment design (from statistics).</p>
