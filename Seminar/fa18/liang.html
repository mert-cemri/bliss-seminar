<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>SGD Converges to Global Minimum in Deep Learning via Star-Convex Path</b> <br />
Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been found to be remarkably effective in training a variety of deep neural networks. However, there is still a lack of understanding on how and why SGD can train these complex networks towards a global minimum. In this talk, I will present our recent establishment of the convergence of SGD to a global minimum in training deep neural networks. Our argument exploits the following two important properties: 1) the training loss can achieve zero value (approximately), which has been widely observed in deep learning; 2) SGD follows a star-convex path, which is verified by various experiments in our work. Following these two facts, our analysis shows that SGD, although has long been considered as a randomized algorithm, converges in an intrinsically deterministic manner to a global minimum.</p>
