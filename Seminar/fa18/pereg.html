<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Arbitrarily Varying Broadcast and Relay Channels</b> <br />
Two models of an arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) are studied; both are relevant to modern networks under jamming attacks by an adversary or a hacker. The arbitrarily varying
broadcast channel is considered when state information is available at the transmitter in a causal manner. Inner and outer bounds are established, on both the random code capacity
region and the deterministic code capacity region with degraded message sets. The form of
the bounds raises the question whether the minimax theorem can be generalized to rate
regions, i.e. whether the order of the intersection over state distributions and the union
over Shannon strategies can be interchanged. A sufficient condition is given, under which
this assertion holds and the random code capacity region is determined. As an example, the
arbitrarily varying binary symmetric broadcast channel is examined, showing that there are
cases where the condition holds, hence the capacity region is determined, and other cases
where there is a gap between the bounds. The gap implies that the minimax theorem does
not always hold for rate regions.</p>
<p>In the second part of the talk, a new model is introduced, namely, the arbitrarily varying
relay channel. The results include the cutset bound, decode-forward bound and partial
decode-forward bound on the random code capacity, which require modification of the
usual methods for the AVC to fit the block Markov coding scheme. The random code
capacity is further determined for special cases. Then, deterministic coding schemes are
considered, and the deterministic code capacity is derived under certain conditions, for the degraded and reversely degraded relay channel, and the case of orthogonal sender
components. The following question is addressed: If the encoder-decoder and encoder-relay
marginals are both symmetrizable, does that necessarily imply zero capacity? We show and
explain why the answer is no. The random code capacity is determined for the arbitrarily
varying Gaussian relay channel with sender frequency division, and the deterministic code
capacity is bounded using the techniques of Csisz&</p>
