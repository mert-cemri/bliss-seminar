== Title and Abstract
*A Convex Duality Framework for GANs* \n
Generative adversarial network (GAN) is a minimax game between a generator mimicking the true model and a discriminator distinguishing the samples produced by the generator from the real training samples. Given a discriminator trained over the entire space of functions, this game reduces to finding the generative model which minimizes a divergence score, e.g. the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence, to the data distribution. However, in practice the discriminator is trained over smaller function classes such as convolutional neural networks. Then, a natural question is how the divergence minimization interpretation changes as we constrain the discriminator. In this talk, we address this question by developing a convex duality framework for analyzing GANs. We show GANs in general can be interpreted as minimizing divergence between two sets of probability distributions: generative models and discriminator moment matching models. We prove that this interpretation applies to a wide class of existing GAN formulations including vanilla GAN, f-GAN, Wasserstein GAN, Energy-based GAN, and MMD-GAN. We then use the convex duality framework to explain why regularizing the discriminatorâ€™s Lipschitz constant can dramatically improve the models learned by GANs. We numerically demonstrate the power of different Lipschitz regularization methods for improving the training performance in standard GAN settings.
