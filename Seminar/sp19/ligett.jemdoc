== Title and Abstract
*A necessary and sufficient stability notion for adaptive generalization* \n
We introduce a new notion of the stability of computations, which holds under post-processing and adaptive composition, and show that the notion is both necessary and sufficient to ensure generalization in the face of adaptivity, for any computations that respond to bounded-sensitivity linear queries while providing accuracy with respect to the data sample set.  The stability notion is based on quantifying the effect of observing a computationâ€™s outputs on the posterior over the data sample elements.

Joint work with Moshe Shenfeld (HUJI).
