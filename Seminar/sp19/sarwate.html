<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Between Shannon and Hamming: how bad can the channel be?</b> <br />
The information theory community has traditionally studied two different models for communication. The Shannon-theoretic model treats the channelâ€™s impact as random, so codes must correct almost all error patterns of a given weight; this is an average-case analysis. The coding-theoretic (Hamming-theoretic?) model treats the channel as adversarial, so codes must correct all error patterns of a given weight; this is a worst-case analysis. Between the two lie several different models which can be modeled using a channel model (an AVC) in which the channel is controlled by an adversary. The difference between average- and worst-case is captured by explicitly modeling the information available to the adversary. I will describe some of these models and the key role played by coding strategies such as stochastic encoding and list decoding.</p>
<p>This talk may include joint work with Bikash Kumar Dey, Michael Gastpar, Sidharth Jaggi, Michael Langberg, and Carol Wang.</p>
