== Title and Abstract
*Information-theoretic Privacy: Leakage measures, robust privacy guarantees, and generative adversarial mechanism design* \n
Privacy is the problem of ensuring limited leakage of information about sensitive features while
sharing information (utility) about non-private features to legitimate data users. Even as
differential privacy has emerged as a strong desideratum for privacy, there is also an equally strong
need for context-aware utility-guaranteeing approaches in most data sharing settings. This talk
approaches this dual requirement using an information-theoretic approach that includes
operationally motivated leakage measures, design of privacy mechanisms, and verifiable
implementations using generative adversarial models. Specifically, we introduce maximal alpha
leakage as a new class of adversarially motivated tunable leakage measures based on accurately
guessing an arbitrary function of a dataset conditioned on a released dataset. The choice of alpha
determines the specific adversarial action ranging from refining a belief for alpha = 1 to guessing
the best posterior for alpha = âˆž, and for these extremal values this measure simplifies to mutual
information (MI) and maximal leakage (MaxL), respectively. The problem of guaranteeing
privacy can then be viewed as one of designing a randomizing mechanism that minimizes
(maximal) alpha leakage subject to utility constraints. We then present bounds on the robustness
of privacy guarantees that can be made when designing mechanisms from a finite number of
samples. Finally, we focus on a data-driven approach, generative adversarial privacy (GAP), to
design privacy mechanisms using neural networks. GAP is modeled as a constrained minimax
game between a privatizer (intent on publishing a utility-guaranteeing learning representation that
limits leakage of the sensitive features) and an adversary (intent on learning the sensitive features).
We demonstrate the performance of GAP on multi-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and the
GENKI dataset. Time permitting, we will briefly discuss the learning-theoretic underpinnings of
GAP as well as connections to the problem of algorithmic fairness.
This work is a result of multiple collaborations: (a) maximal alpha leakage with J. Liao (ASU),
O. Kosut (ASU), and F. P. Calmon (Harvard); (b) robust mechanism design with M. Diaz
(ASU), H. Wang (Harvard), and F. P. Calmon (Harvard); and (c) GAP with C. Huang (ASU), P.
Kairouz (Google), X. Chen (Stanford), and R. Rajagopal (Stanford).
