<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Reproducing AlphaZero: what we learn</b> <br />
We reproduce and open source AlphaGoZero or AlphaZero framework using 2000 GPUs and 9 days, achieving super-human performance of Go AI that beats 4 top-30 professional players with 20-0, provide extensive ablation studies and perform basic analysis. In this talk we will share our journey and interesting first-hand experience that makes a large-scale RL system work. Hopefully it will spur future research both practically and theoretically.</p>
