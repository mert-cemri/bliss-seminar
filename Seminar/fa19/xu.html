<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Spectral graph matching and regularized quadratic relaxations </b> <br />
<br />
Given two unlabeled, edge-correlated graphs on the same set of vertices, 
we study the &ldquo;graph matching&rdquo; problem of identifying the unknown mapping 
from vertices of the first graph to those of the second. This amounts to solving 
a computationally intractable quadratic assignment problem. We propose 
a new spectral method, which computes the eigendecomposition of the two graph 
adjacency matrices and returns a matching based on the pairwise alignments 
between all eigenvectors of the first graph with all eigenvectors of the second. 
Each alignment is inversely weighted by the distance between the corresponding eigenvalues. 
This spectral method can be equivalently viewed as solving a regularized 
quadratic programming relaxation of the quadratic assignment problem. 
We show that for a correlated Erdos-Renyi model, this method can return 
the exact matching with high probability if the two graphs differ by at most 
a 1/polylog(n) fraction of edges, both for dense graphs and for sparse graphs 
with at least polylog(n) average degree. Our analysis exploits local laws 
for the resolvents of sparse Wigner matrices. Based on joint work with 
Zhou Fan, Cheng Mao, Yihong Wu, all at Yale.</p>
