== About
The BLISS seminar (formerly [http://www-networking.eecs.berkeley.edu/Seminar/ NCD seminar]) 
#is co-sponsored by generous grants from [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/ Microsoft Research] and [www.qualcomm.com Qualcomm], and 
is the area seminar of the [http://bliss.eecs.berkeley.edu Berkeley Laboratory for Information and System Sciences]. Talks at the seminar cover topics including but not limited to information and coding theory, signal processing, optimization, statistics, and control. The list of talks for the current semester can be found below, and past seminars from 2016 onwards are listed [past.html here]. For an archive of all talks from 1996-2015, visit the [http://www-networking.eecs.berkeley.edu/Seminar/ old webpage.]

A calendar of all the talks is maintained [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/1?cid=YmVya2VsZXkuZWR1X2Fub2JqY2JqMjJ2Z2M2M3F0cXJtZWowN21jQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20 here]. Feel free to add it to your own.
