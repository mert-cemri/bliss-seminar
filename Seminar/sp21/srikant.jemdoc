== Title and Abstract

*Sample Complexity and Overparameterization Bounds for Neural Temporal Difference Learning*\n
\n
 
We will consider the dynamics of projection-free temporal-difference learning with neural network-based value function approximation over a general state space, and present bounds on the sample complexity and overparameterization required to achieve a desired accuracy. Our bounds are based on a Lyapunov drift analysis of the network parameters as a stopped random process. Joint work with Semih Cayci, Siddhartha Satpathi and Niao He.
