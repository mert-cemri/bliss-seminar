<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>The planted matching problem: Sharp threshold and infinite-order phase transition</b><br />
<br /></p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by applications such as particle tracking, we study the planted matching problem, where the goal is to reconstruct a perfect matching planted in a randomly weighted bipartite graph, whose planted and unplanted edge weights are independently drawn from two different distributions. We determine the sharp threshold at which the optimal reconstruction error (fraction of misclassified edges) exhibits a phase transition from non-zero to zero. Furthermore, in the special case of exponential weight distributions, this phase transition is shown to be of infinite-order and we further determine
the reconstruction error of the maximum likelihood estimation in terms of a system of differential equations that result from a message-passing algorithm.</p>
<p>The talk is based on joint work with Jian Ding (Penn), Yihong Wu (Yale), Dana Yang (Duke), Mehrdad Moharrami (UIUC), and Cristopher Moore (SFI).
