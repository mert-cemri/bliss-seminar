<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Submodularity and Optimal Transport in ML: new applications and algorithms</b> <br /></p>
<p>Submodularity and Optimal Transport (OT) are two powerful mathematical concepts with multiple potential benefits to be exploited in machine learning. In this talk, I will outline combinations and some new applications and algorithms for these concepts. 
First, we show how submodularity can be leveraged to solve a non-convex saddle point problem to global optimality (under conditions). Our method relies on connections to OT, and the resulting algorithm solves a robust budget allocation (or bipartite influence maximization) problem with uncertain parameters.
Second, we combine submodularity and Optimal Transport for a new, structured assignment model that encourages coupled assignments and has applications from domain adaptation to NLP. If time permits, I will also sketch new results on scalable computation of Wasserstein barycenters with applications to parallel Bayesian inference.</p>
<p>This talk is based on joint works with Matthew Staib, David Alvarez Melis, Sebastian Claici, Tommi Jaakkola and Justin Solomon.</p>
