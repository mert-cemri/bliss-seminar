<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Primal-dual first-order methods for convex optimization</b> <br /></p>
<p>The talk will be on primal-dual first order methods derived from the
Douglas-Rachford operator splitting algorithm.
We will start with some applications to image deblurring problems
that illustrate the versatility of the Douglas-Rachford method for
primal-dual decomposition in large scale optimization.
The second part of the talk will be concerned with the important
primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method.  This method is widely used in
image processing, computer vision, and machine learning.
We will show how the PDHG method can be derived from the Douglas-Rachford
splitting method, and discuss some implications of this derivation for
the convergence analysis and extensions of PDHG.
(Joint work with Daniel O'Connor.)</p>
