<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>On the challenge of gene regulatory network reconstruction from high throughput sequencing data</b> <br />
Gene regulatory networks are central to the functioning of biological organisms. High throughput genetic sequencing technology has enabled the production of massive amounts of data pertaining to activation levels of genes, which has the potential to help scientists reverse engineer gene regulatory networks. In this talk I will briefly explain the steps from data collection to network modelling and analysis that go into the process for a particular study examining soybean plants.</p>
