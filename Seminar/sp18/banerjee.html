<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Allocating Resources, in the future</b> <br />
The online allocation of scarce resources is one of the canonical problems in operations, and more generally, in many fields of engineering. In this talk, I will re-examine basic online resource allocation, with the aim of building bridges between these problems and the ever-improving prediction tools. To this end, I will present a new Bayesian-learning inspired algorithm for online stochastic packing problems which achieves the first horizon and budget independent regret bounds for these settings. Surprisingly, the result stems from elementary underlying tools - LP sensitivity and basic concentration of measure.
Joint work with Alberto Vera.</p>
