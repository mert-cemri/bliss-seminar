<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Machine Learning for Real-Time Constrained Optimization: The Case of Optimal Power Flow and Beyond</b><br />
<br /></p>
<p>Optimization problems subject to hard constraints are common in time-critical applications such as autonomous driving and high-frequency trading. However, existing iterative solvers often face difficulties in solving these problems in real-time. In this talk, we advocate a machine learning approach &ndash; to employ NN's approximation capability to learn the input-solution mapping of a problem and then pass new input through the NN to obtain a quality solution, orders of magnitude faster than iterative solvers. To date, the approach has achieved promising empirical performance and exciting theoretical development for an essential optimal power flow (OPF) problem in grid operation. A fundamental issue, however, is to ensure NN solution feasibility with respect to the hard constraints, which is non-trivial due to inherent NN prediction errors. To this end, we present two approaches, predict-and-reconstruct and homeomorphic projection, to ensure NN solution strictly satisfies the equality and inequality constraints, respectively. In particular, homeomorphic projection is a low-complexity scheme to guarantee NN solution feasibility for optimization over any set homeomorphic to a unit ball, covering all compact convex sets and certain classes of nonconvex sets. The idea is to (i) learn a minimum distortion homeomorphic mapping between the constraint set and a unit ball using an invertible NN (INN), and then (ii) perform a simple bisection operation concerning the unit ball so that the INN-mapped final solution is feasible with respect to the constraint set with minor distortion-induced optimality loss. We prove the feasibility guarantee and bound the optimality loss under mild conditions. Simulation results, including those for non-convex AC-OPF problems in power grid operation, show that homeomorphic projection outperforms existing methods in solution feasibility and run-time complexity, while achieving similar optimality loss. We will also discuss open problems and future directions.</p>
