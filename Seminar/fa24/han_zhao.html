<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Revisiting Scalarization in Multi-Task Learning</b><br />
<br /></p>
<p>Linear scalarization, i.e., combining all loss functions by a weighted sum, has been the default choice in the literature of multi-task learning (MTL) since its inception. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in developing Specialized Multi-Task Optimizers (SMTOs) that treat MTL as a multi-objective optimization problem. However, it remains open whether there is a fundamental advantage of SMTOs over scalarization. In fact, heated debates exist in the community comparing these two types of algorithms, mostly from an empirical perspective. In this talk, I will revisit scalarization from a theoretical perspective. I will be focusing on linear MTL models and studying whether scalarization is capable of fully exploring the Pareto front. Our findings reveal that, in contrast to recent works that claimed empirical advantages of scalarization, scalarization is inherently incapable of full exploration, especially for those Pareto optimal solutions that strike the balanced trade-offs between multiple tasks. More concretely, when the model is under-parametrized, we reveal a multi-surface structure of the feasible region and identify necessary and sufficient conditions for full exploration. This leads to the conclusion that scalarization is in general incapable of tracing out the Pareto front. Our theoretical results provide a more intuitive explanation of why scalarization fails. I will conclude the talk by briefly discussing the extension of our results to general nonlinear neural networks and our recent work on using online Chebyshev scalarization to controllably steer the search of Pareto optimal solutions.</p>
