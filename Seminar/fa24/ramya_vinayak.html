<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Towards Pluralistic Alignment: Foundations for Learning Diverse Human Preferences</b><br />
<br /></p>
<p>Large pre-trained models trained on internet-scale data are often not ready for deployment out-
of-the-box. They are heavily fine-tuned or aligned using large quantities of human preference
data, usually elicited using pairwise comparisons. While aligning an AI/ML model to human
preferences or values, it is important to ask whose preference and values we are aligning it to?
The current approaches of preference alignment are severely limited due to inherent assumption
of uniformity by the preference models. We aim to overcome this limitation by building mathematical
foundations for learning diverse human preferences. In this talk, I will present, PAL, a personalize-
able reward modelling framework for pluralistic alignment. PAL has modular design that
leverages commonalities across users while catering to individual personalization, enabling
efficient few-shot generalization. PAL is versatile to be applied to various domains and matches
or outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both text-to-text and text-to-image tasks with 100x
fewer parameters in practice. I will also present theoretical results on per user sample complexity
for generalization and fundamental limitations when there are limited pairwise comparisons.
Based on work with Daiwei Chen, Yi Chen, Aniket Rege, Zhi Wang, Geelon So, Greg Canal, Blake
Mason, Gokcan Tatli, and Rob Nowak. </p>
