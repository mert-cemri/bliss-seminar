*Near-Optimal No-Regret Learning for General Convex Games --- The Role of Positive Regret
*\n
\n

A recent line of work has established uncoupled learning dynamics such that, when employed by all players in a game, each playerâ€™s regret after T repetitions grows polylogarithmically in T, an exponential improvement over the traditional guarantees within the no-regret framework. However, so far these results have only been limited to certain classes of games with structured strategy spaces, such as normal-form and extensive-form games. In this work, we significantly simplify, improve, and extend these results, showing that near-optimal O(log T) per-player regret is achievable for general convex games via a new and efficient learning dynamic. The key idea of our approach starts from a simple observation that it suffices to control the positive part of the regret, which we then show can be converted to the standard regret of a modified problem in a lifted space. 

This talk is based on the following two joint works with Ioannis Anagnostides, Gabriele Farina, Christian Kroer, Chung-Wei Lee, and Tuomas Sandholm:\n
