<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>A Universal Catalyst for First-Order Optimization</b> <br />
We introduce a generic scheme for accelerating first-order
optimization methods in the sense of Nesterov. Our approach consists
of minimizing a convex objective by approximately solving a sequence
of well-chosen auxiliary problems, leading to faster convergence. This
strategy applies to a large class of algorithms, including gradient
descent, block coordinate descent, SAG, SAGA, SDCA, SVRG, Finito/MISO, and
their proximal variants. For all of these approaches, we
provide acceleration and explicit support for non-strongly convex
objectives.
In addition to theoretical speed-up, we also show that acceleration is
useful in practice, especially for ill-conditioned problems where we
measure significant improvements. </p>
<p>This is joint work with Hongzhou
Lin and Zaid Harchaoui.</p>
<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Julien Mairal is a research scientist at INRIA in the project LEAR. He was
previously a postdoctoral researcher in the statistics department at
Berkeley, and before that, did his PhD at INRIA in the project WILLOW under
the supervision of Jean Ponce and Francis Bach. He is interested in machine
learning, optimization, computer vision, statistical signal and image
processing, and also has some interest in bio-informatics and neurosciences</p>
