<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>A View of Information-Estimation Relations in Gaussian Networks</b> <br /></p>
<p>This talk will focus on the recent applications of
Information-Estimation Relations to Gaussian
Networks. In the first part of the talk, we will go over recent connections
between estimation theoretic and
information theoretic measures. The estimation theoretic measures that would
be of importance to us are
the Minimum Means p-th Error (MMPE) and its special case the Minimum Mean
Square Error (MMSE). As
will be demonstrated, the MMSE can be very useful in bounding mutual
information via the I-MMSE
relationship of Guo-Shamai-Verdu, and the MMPE can be used to bound the
conditional entropy via the
moment entropy inequality.
In the second part of the talk, we will discuss several applications of
Information-Estimation Relations in
Gaussian noise networks. As the first application, we show how the I-MMSE
relationship can be used to
determine the behavior, for every signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), of the mutual
information and the MMSE of
the transmitted codeword for the setting of the Gaussian Broadcast Channel and
the Gaussian Wiretap Channel.
As a second application, the notion of the MMPE is used to generalize the
Ozarow-Wyner lower bound on
the mutual information for discrete inputs on Gaussian noise channels.
A short outlook of future applications concludes the presentation.</p>
