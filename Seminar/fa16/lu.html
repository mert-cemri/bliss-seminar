<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>High-Dimensional Analysis of Stochastic Optimization
Algorithms: Limiting Dynamics and Phase Transitions</b> <br />
We consider efficient iterative methods (e.g., stochastic
gradient descent, randomized Kaczmarz algorithms,
iterative coordinate descent) for solving large-scale
optimization problems, whether convex or nonconvex. A
flurry of recent work has focused on establishing their
theoretical performance guarantees. This intense interest is
spurred on by the remarkably impressive empirical
performance achieved by these low-complexity and
memory-efficient methods.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will present a framework for analyzing the
exact dynamics of these methods in the high-dimensional
limit. For concreteness, we consider two prototypical
problems: regularized linear regression (e.g. LASSO) and
sparse principal component analysis. For each case, we
show that the time-varying estimates given by the
algorithms will converge weakly to a deterministic “limiting
process” in the high-dimensional (scaling and mean-field)
limit. Moreover, this limiting process can be characterized
as the unique solution of a nonlinear PDE, and it provides
exact information regarding the asymptotic performance of
the algorithms. For example, performance metrics such as
the MSE, the cosine similarity and the misclassification rate
in sparse support recovery can all be obtained by
examining the deterministic limiting process. A steady-state
analysis of the nonlinear PDE also reveals interesting
phase transition phenomenons related to the performance
of the algorithms. Although our analysis is asymptotic in
nature, numerical simulations show that the theoretical
predictions are accurate for moderate signal dimensions.
What makes our analysis tractable is the notion of
exchangeability, a fundamental property of symmetry that is
inherent in many of the optimization problems encountered
in signal processing and machine learning.</p>

<p>Yue M. Lu was born in Shanghai. After finishing
undergraduate studies at Shanghai Jiao Tong University,
he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
where he received the M.Sc. degree in mathematics and
the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering, both in 2007. He
was a Research Assistant at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, and has worked for Microsoft
Research Asia, Beijing, and Siemens Corporate Research,
Princeton, NJ. Following his work as a postdoctoral
researcher at the Audiovisual Communications Laboratory
at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL),
Switzerland, he joined Harvard University in 2010, where
he is currently an Associate Professor of Electrical
Engineering at the John A. Paulson School of Engineering
and Applied Sciences.</p>
<p>He received the Most Innovative Paper Award (with Minh N.
Do) of IEEE International Conference on Image Processing
(ICIP) in 2006, the Best Student Paper Award of IEEE ICIP
in 2007, and the Best Student Presentation Award at the
31st SIAM SEAS Conference in 2007. Student papers
supervised and coauthored by him won the Best Student
Paper Award (with Ivan Dokmanic and Martin Vetterli) of
IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and
Signal Processing in 2011 and the Best Student Paper
Award (with Ameya Agaskar and Chuang Wang) of IEEE
Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing
(GlobalSIP) in 2014.
He has been an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions
on Image Processing since 2014, an Elected Member of
the IEEE Image, Video, and Multidimensional Signal
Processing Technical Committee since 2015, and an
Elected Member of the IEEE Signal Processing Theory and
Methods Technical Committee since 2016. He received the
ECE Illinois Young Alumni Achievement Award in 2015</p>
