== Title and Abstract
*Erasure Coding for Big-data Systems: Theory and Practice* \n
Erasure codes are being increasingly deployed as an alternative to data replication in large-scale, distributed storage systems to achieve fault tolerance in a storage-efficient manner. While traditional erasure codes are optimal in utilizing storage space, they significantly increase the usage of other important resources such as network, I/O, and CPU. 

In the first part of this thesis, we construct new erasure codes as well as design and build erasure-coded storage systems that reduce the usage of network, I/O, and CPU by a significant amount while not compromising on storage efficiency. The codes proposed in this thesis have been evaluated on Facebook's data warehouse cluster in production, and will be a part of the next release of the Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). 

In the second part of this thesis, we explore new avenues for erasure coding in big-data systems. Erasure codes have been primarily employed for achieving space-efficient fault tolerance in disk-based storage systems, that is, to durably store "cold'' (less-frequently accessed) data. We explore the applicability of erasure codes beyond this setting, in particular for "hot'' (more-frequently accessed) data by showing how erasure coding can be employed to improve load balancing (by more than 3x), and to reduce latencies (by more than 2x) in data-intensive cluster caches.

This is the speakerâ€™s dissertation talk.
