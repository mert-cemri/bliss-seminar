<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Towards an Algebraic Network Information Theory</b> <br />
The IID random coding argument, a particular instance of the probabilistic method, is arguably one of the crown jewels of classical information theory. It establishes capacity in many point-to-point communication scenarios, but fails to play a similarly fundamental role in communication networks. Inklings of this issue have been observed at least since Korner and Marton’s 1979 paper, where the receiver is only interested in the modulo-sum of the transmitted messages; a rather unusual goal. More recent work has shown that this fundamental limitation continues to apply even for the usual problem of pure data transmission. That work also elucidates that one key missing ingredient is the algebraic structure of the underlying error-correcting codes. The key goal of our work is to include such algebraic structure firmly into Network Information Theory. Specifically, we present a joint typicality framework for encoding and decoding nested linear codes for multi-user networks. This framework provides a new perspective on compute-forward within the context of discrete memoryless networks. In particular, it establishes an achievable rate region for computing the weighted sum of nested linear codewords over a discrete memoryless multiple-access channel (MAC). When specialized to the Gaussian MAC, this rate region recovers and improves upon the lattice-based compute-forward rate region, thus providing a unified approach for discrete memoryless and Gaussian networks. Furthermore, this framework can be used to shed light on the joint decoding rate region for compute-forward, which is considered an open problem. Specifically, this work establishes an achievable rate region for simultaneously decoding two linear combinations of nested linear codewords from K senders.</p>
