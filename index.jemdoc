== General Information

Berkeley Laboratory for Information and System Sciences is a research center in the [https://eecs.berkeley.edu/ Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department] at the [https://www.berkeley.edu/ University of California, Berkeley]. The lab focuses on theoretical problems in information and data science, broadly defined. Specific research areas include communications, information and coding theory, networking, optimization, statistics, machine learning, and control.

BLISS currently comprises 8 main faculty, 18 students and 4 postdocs. The lab is located in 264 Cory Hall.

[https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ananth/ Venkat Anantharam] \n 
Anantharam's work studies foundational problems arising in communication networks, information theory, coding theory, game theory and stochastic control.
A focus on the distributed nature of information in networks, differing objectives of the participants, behavioral aspects, how to deal with resource constraints, security, and the role of asymptotics in taming complexity are a feature of significant parts of the work.

[https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~courtade/ Thomas Courtade] \n 
Courtade's research interests are in the area of information theory, broadly defined. In particular, his research efforts over the past few years have included topics in core Shannon theory (e.g., capacity and rate-distortion theorems), computational biology (e.g., algorithms for DNA assembly and compression of sequencing data), and he has recently been exploring connections between information measures, functional analysis and probability theory (e.g., information inequalities and statistical limit theorems).

[https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kannanr/ Kannan Ramchandran] \n 
Ramchandran's research interests are broadly in the area of distributed systems theory and algorithms intersecting the fields of signal processing, communications, coding and information theory, and networking. His current systems focus is on large-scale distributed storage, large-scale collaborative video content delivery, and biological systems, with research challenges including latency, privacy and security, remote synchronization, sparse sampling, and shotgun genome sequencing.
